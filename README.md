# SolidBaseGoStructure
SolidBaseGoStructure is a well-architected Go backend server that adheres to SOLID design principles and clean architecture. It is built with scalability, testability, and maintainability in mind. The project uses PostgreSQL as the primary relational database and is structured to cleanly separate concerns across layers such as domain, application, infrastructure, and delivery (API/HTTP).

Key goals of the project:

           Apply SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)

           Enable modular, scalable codebase using Goâ€™s idioms

           Use PostgreSQL for robust relational data management

           Serve as a base template for REST API projects in Go
